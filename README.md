# Learning Log
Learning Log is a tutorial project using Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course book.
This project uses Django to create a fullstack web app that will allow users to
log the topics that they are learning about and make entries associated with
that topic. A user will be able to either sign in or register for an account,
and then be able to create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit old
entries.

Please try it out by clicking on the link below. It may take a few seconds for the site to load due to using a free Heroku account.
